## PixeLAW: Autonomous Pixel Playground

PixeLAW is an anutonomous pixel playground built using [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo) and [Dojo](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo). PixeLAW has a core layer so that builders can create their own applications top of it. These apps share states and interact each other.

This book is dedicated to familiarizing you with PixeLAW and its potential. A special section on the [Theory](./theory/autonomous-worlds.md) elucidates this emergent concept of autonomous worlds.

The main contents are as follows.
- [Quickstart](./getting-started/quick-start.md)
- [What is PixeLAW?](./theory/what-is-pixelaw.md)
- [Explore the Architecture](./architecture/overview.md)
- [Tutorial](./tutorial/setup-deploy/README.md)
